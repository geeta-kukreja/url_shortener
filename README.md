# URL Shortener Take-Home Project
This project is a URL shortener service designed to create concise, memorable URLs from lengthy or complex ones. Itâ€™s built to handle high traffic with optimal performance by leveraging a modern tech stack.


## Features


* POST `/url/shorten`: accepts a URL to shorten (e.g. https://www.google.com) and returns a short URL that 
  can be resolved at a later time (e.g. http://localhost:8000/r/abc)
* GET `r/<short_url>`: resolve the given short URL (e.g. http://localhost:8000/r/abc) to its original URL
  (e.g. https://www.google.com). If the short URL is unknown, an HTTP 404 response is returned.
* DELETE `url/<short_url>`: deletes the given short URL if exist (e.g. http://localhost:8000/url/abc)
* POST `/url/custom-shorten`: accepts a URL and customer short URL to our service (e.g. https://www.google.com, google) and generates it if is available to use
